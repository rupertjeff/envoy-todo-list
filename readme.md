# Envoy Todo List Example

## Project Specs

The project you will be creating is a simple todo list/task manager. Hereâ€™s what the minimum requirements are:

### Backend

* [x] Using MVC principles, craft an application that supports Tasks and Users
* [x] Each Task will belong to a particular User, and a User can have many Tasks
* [ ] The app should run through a single page (may want to use AJAX for this)

### Frontend

* [ ] Create a single page responsive layout
* [ ] There should be a form that allows you to select a User, and add a Task to the ToDo list
* [ ] The Task should at the very least include a title
* [x] BONUS: Allow users to create a short description of the Task
* [ ] BONUS: Create categories for Tasks, and organize tasks by category
* [ ] In a separate section on the page, show a list of all the Tasks currently assigned
* [ ] Make sure to implement a way to delete tasks (may want AJAX for this)
* [ ] The design is completely up to you -- creative freedom!
* [x] BONUS: Use a JavaScript framework like Angular.js or Backbone.js
